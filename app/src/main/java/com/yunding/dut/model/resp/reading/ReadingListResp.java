In 1973, the arrival of TV via satellite introduced the Inuit to \u201csouthern\u201d (Canadian and U.S.) culture. Watching television became a popular way to pass the long, dark Arctic nights. From the point of view of the Inuit, the results were mixed.\r\n Before 1973, life in a typical Inuit village largely revolved around family and neighbors. Children went to school during the day to learn basic arithmetic and language skills, including the study of Inuktitut, the traditional language of the Inuit. Inuktitut has been spoken for thousands of years, but it has only been written in recent years. After school and on weekends, young people learned hunting and fishing skills from their elders. Of course they did not learn only hunting skills, but also important values. For example, values such as sharing and cooperation were necessary for survival in the harsh northern environment.\r\n But in 1973, along came the first of Canada\u2019s Anik satellites, and life in Northern Canada changed drastically. Children learned English but started to lose their own Inuit language. Young people quickly picked up new ideas, new values, and new attitudes from television. Some of these were a challenge to the old ways; for example, the focus on individual materialism and ownership in TV ads and game shows contradicted the traditional importance given to cooperation. Work and school attendance and time spent hunting and fishing dropped. Young people didn\u2019t want to learn hunting and fishing skills from their elders anymore. As one Inuit elder said, \u201cWhen television first came, the effect of television on the community was drastic. People no longer visited their neighbors. Children did not play outside, and the interactive activities of the community in general were broken down. The home and the family was the last refuge of the Inuit language.

O. Henry was a pen name used by an American writer of short stories. His real name was William Sydney Porter. He was born in North Carolina in 1862. As a young boy he lived an exciting life. He did not go to school for very long, but he managed to teach himself everything he needed to know. When he was about 20 years old, O. Henry went to Texas, where he tried different jobs. He first worked on a newspaper, and then had a job in a bank, when some money went missing from the bank O. Henry was believed to have stolen it. Because of that, he was sent to prison. During the three years in prison, he learned to write short stories. After he got out of prison, he went to New York and continued writing. He wrote mostly about New York and the life of the poor there.
